# Workflows

`mana-agent` supports a few common repository-assistant workflows: initial analysis, targeted questions, interactive chat, and resuming a saved automation run. The command docs describe the available entry points and the outputs they produce. [docs/04-commands.md:1-171](docs/04-commands.md:1-171) [docs/03-quick-start.md:1-119](docs/03-quick-start.md:1-119)

## 1. Start with repository analysis

Use `analyze` when you want a structured pass over a codebase:

```bash
mana-agent analyze /path/to/project
```

This command resolves the target repository, indexes it, runs dependency and structure analysis, performs static findings, can include semantic search when `--query` is supplied, and writes report artifacts under the project’s `.mana/` directory. [docs/03-quick-start.md:1-119](docs/03-quick-start.md:1-119) [docs/04-commands.md:1-171](docs/04-commands.md:1-171)

A good first pass is to run `analyze` before asking follow-up questions, because the output provides a broad map of the repository.

## 2. Ask focused questions

After analysis, use `ask` for targeted repository-grounded questions:

```bash
mana-agent ask "How is configuration loaded?" --root-dir /path/to/project
```

`ask` supports a direct index, directory-aware mode, ephemeral indexes, agent tool use, and JSON output. When enabled, it can return sources and trace information. [docs/03-quick-start.md:1-119](docs/03-quick-start.md:1-119) [docs/04-commands.md:1-171](docs/04-commands.md:1-171)

Use this workflow when you need evidence for a specific behavior, file, or data flow.

## 3. Open an interactive chat session

Use `chat` when you want a conversational workspace for repository exploration or coding tasks:

```bash
mana-agent chat --root-dir /path/to/project
```

The chat command supports coding-agent workflows, tool-worker execution, coding memory, planning mode, and auto-execute flows. It is the most flexible option for iterative problem solving. [docs/03-quick-start.md:1-119](docs/03-quick-start.md:1-119) [docs/04-commands.md:1-171](docs/04-commands.md:1-171)

Typical chat use cases include:

- exploring unfamiliar modules
- tracing a bug through multiple files
- planning a change before editing code
- iterating on a task with memory of prior context

The documentation notes that coding memory may be stored at `<project>/.mana/index/chat_memory.sqlite3`. [docs/04-commands.md:1-171](docs/04-commands.md:1-171)

## 4. Resume an automated run

Use `continue` to pick up a persisted auto-execute session:

```bash
mana-agent continue --root-dir /path/to/project --run-id <run_id>
```

This command resumes a run from `<root>/.mana/runs/<run_id>` and accepts limits for passes, tool calls, runtime, cost, and resume cycles. [docs/04-commands.md:1-171](docs/04-commands.md:1-171)

This workflow is useful when an earlier automated run stopped before finishing and you want to continue it without restarting from scratch.

## Suggested sequence

1. Configure the environment and verify the CLI.
2. Run `mana-agent analyze` to build repository context.
3. Use `mana-agent ask` for precise questions.
4. Switch to `mana-agent chat` for iterative analysis or editing.
5. Use `mana-agent continue` when resuming a previous auto-execute run.

## Operational tips

- Use `--json` when you want machine-readable output. [docs/03-quick-start.md:1-119](docs/03-quick-start.md:1-119) [docs/04-commands.md:1-171](docs/04-commands.md:1-171)
- Keep project-generated artifacts under `.mana/` so they stay tied to the analyzed repository. [docs/03-quick-start.md:1-119](docs/03-quick-start.md:1-119)
- Prefer `analyze` before `ask` when you want better context for a complex question.
